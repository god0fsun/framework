# FRAMEWORK
### *Keep in mind that this framework is a work in progress, you may see all current progress in the <a href="https://trello.com/b/oWUHIGhD/framework">trello</a>!*
### I plan to make a github page with the api and examples for anyone who plans to use this, but this is mostly just a passion project and something i'll be using so it may not be up to standards with frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit/">Knit</a>.
