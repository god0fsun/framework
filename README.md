# FRAMEWORK
### *Keep in mind that this framework is a work in progress, you may see all current progress in the <a href="https://trello.com/b/oWUHIGhD/framework">trello</a>!*
## I plan to make a github page with the api and examples for anyone who plans to use this, but this is mostly just a passion project and something i'll be using so it may not be up to standards with frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit/">Knit</a>.

A framework made for ROBLOX, which features things like:
 <ul>
  <li>Utilities that make parts of developing simple and efficient</li>
  <li>Modular, so you'll only need 2 scripts to run the framework and the rest are modules</li>
  <li>Controller -> Service Communication, so you can run and access methods/properties that are for the client</li>
  <li>A custom made remote system which uses the <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RemoteFunction">RemoteFunction</a> and <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RemoteEvent">RemoteEvent</a> classes</li>
  <li>In development still, which means its being updated and fixed consistently to make it bigger and better for everyone</li>
</ul> 

<hr>

# Since my framework is still in development, that means it can be unreliable at times and some methods I use may cause lag or problems and can be subject to change. I am still trying to improve on my code and utilties to make them more efficient so that developers can easily run and use the framework without issue.
